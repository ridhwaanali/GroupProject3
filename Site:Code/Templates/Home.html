        <h4> In a world where economic development and the well-being of populations go hand in hand, exploring the intricate relationship between GDP per capita and population data can offer compelling insights. GDP per capita is a metric that calculates the average income per individual in a country by dividing the GDP by its population. It offers an individual-centric view of the economy, allowing for an assessment of the economic well-being and living standards of a country's citizens. This measure is particularly useful for comparing the economic development and quality of life across different nations, as it takes into account the population size of each country. Our proposal is to create this interactive website that seamlessly integrates drop-down menus and data filters, enabling users to delve into this captivating tale and gain a comprehensive understanding of global economic trends.
